# test-action-composite

This repository contains a composite GitHub Action that demonstrates how to call one action from within another action.
It consists of two actions: an outer action and an inner action. The outer action calls the inner action as part of its workflow.

It is intended for testing and demonstration purposes only, e.g. by [github.com/actionforge/test-workflow-composite](https://github.com/actionforge/test-workflow-composite).
